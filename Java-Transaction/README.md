Here are real-world examples of the most common transaction propagation behaviors in Java, specifically Spring.

1. **REQUIRED**: This is the most common propagation setting. It means if there's an existing transaction, that transaction will be used.
    If there's no transaction, a new one will be started.
   - Example: If you're transferring money between two bank accounts, the entire operation, which consists of the withdrawal from account 1 and the deposit into account 2, should be covered by a single transaction.

2. **SUPPORTS**: This means that if there's an existing transaction, the method will run in that transaction. If there's no transaction, the method will run without a transaction.
    - Example: Reading data from a table. If a transaction already exists, the read will be part of that transaction and hence the data read will be consistent with other data read/written in that transaction. If a transaction does not exist, the read can proceed outside of a transaction as consistency is not crucial.

3. **REQUIRES_NEW**: A new transaction is always started, even if an existing transaction is already in progress.
   - Example: Audit logging, you might not want the logging to participate in an ongoing transaction as you always want the log to be saved irrespective of the result of the transaction.

4. **MANDATORY**: This means that a transaction must already exist. If there's no existing transaction, an exception will get thrown.
   - Example: If you have a method that makes changes to the database, but should only be used as part of a larger transaction, you'd specify mandatory propagation and it won't be able to be run on its own.

5. **NOT_SUPPORTED**: This means that if there's an existing transaction, it will be paused while this method execution takes place.
   - Example: If you have a read-only operation that can return a large amount of data that you don't want to lock, you might specify NOT_SUPPORTED so the reading operation won't lock any rows.

6. **NEVER**: This means that a transaction must not already exist. If there's an existing transaction, an exception will get thrown.
   - Example: In login operations and non-transactional operations, you might not want these operations to participate in your business transactions.

7. **NESTED**: If a transaction exists, a save point will be taken and this transaction will be nested within the existing one. If no transaction exists, it behaves like REQUIRED.
   - Example: When a particular step in a process fails, you want to rollback this step only and not the whole transaction. Here, you'd use nested transaction to have a sub-transaction. This way you wouldn't affect the complete transaction.

Remember to choose the correct propagation behaviour depending on your use-case, as wrong propagation can lead to issues in your program.

## Transaction Isolation levels are important to prevent conflicts between transactions. Here are real-world examples for each isolation level:

1. **READ UNCOMMITTED**: In a banking application, one transaction is updating Account A's balance, and another transaction reads Account A's balance while the first transaction is still not completed. Here, the second transaction might read uncommitted data from the first transaction. It's the lowest level of isolation and seldom used because it may lead to many consistency problems, like dirty reads.

2. **READ COMMITTED**: Now, consider the same banking application. In READ COMMITTED level, the second transaction will only read changes made by the first transaction after it has been committed. This level of isolation is generally a well-balanced choice between performance and consistency.

3. **REPEATABLE READ**: In an inventory application, a transaction reads the number of items available, then after some processing, reads the number of items again. With REPEATABLE READ isolation, it's guaranteed to get the same value in row both time it reads, even if changes were made in the meanwhile. It prevents what's known as non-repeatable reads.

4. **SERIALIZABLE**: It is the highest level of isolation. It covers all scenarios which are covered by other isolation levels plus a scenario called the phantom read. For example, in a banking application, two customers apply for a loan at the same time, and the bank can provide a loan to only one customer. The SERIALIZABLE isolation level will ensure that loan allocation to customers will happen serially, avoiding a situation where the bank ends up granting the last loan to multiple requesting customers.

Remember, higher isolation levels provide greater data consistency but reduce concurrent access to data. Thus, choosing the right isolation level depends on the nature of the data and the specific use cases of the application.
